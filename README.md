# One Month Rails

This project is based on the sample application for
[*One Month Rails: Teach Yourself to Code*](http://onemonthrails.com)

by [Paul Kincaid-Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulkincaidsmith/)

I am extending instructor Mattan Griffel's work by adding event notifications delivered by email. This will help other One Month Rails students add email delivery to their projects.

------------------

Fellow OMR students: Does your app need to send email? Most do, and I'll show you how. This project will demo how to send mail reliably from the cloud.  

[SendGrid](http://www.sendgrid.com) is a [developer-friendly](http://sendgrid.com/developers.html) email delivery service. Since virtually every mature web application sends email (e.g. password reset confirmations, purchase notifications, etc.) I will extend Mattan's OMR project to include email notifications which will be delivered [for free](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup) via SendGrid.

Take my beta app for a spin on Heroku: <http://quiet-woodland-8878.herokuapp.com/>
